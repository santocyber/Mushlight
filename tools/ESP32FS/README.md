# Arduino ESP32 filesystem uploader 

- Arduino plugin which packs sketch data folder into SPIFFS, LittleFS or FatFS filesystem image,
and uploads the image to ESP32 flash memory.
- Added custom **"partition.csv"** file processing if it is located in the sketch folder.
- Added esp32 / esp32s2 chip detection based on Arduino IDE selection.
- Added a choice to "Erase all flash".
- You can have only one of three filesystems on same Arduino project as data partition.
- See [bergahl notes for macOS](https://github.com/bergdahl/arduino-esp32fs-plugin/blob/2800b79970d09b3ab39fa4e774ee59bfcb92e036/README.md)

## Notes for SPIFFS

- This is the default filesystem implemented in esp-32 core for /data folder
- Go to Arduino IDE menu: ***Tools > Partition Scheme*** and select an entry with SPIFFS partition

## Notes for LittleFS

- Same partition scheme as SPIFFS
- Until fully implemented to esp-32 core, it needs an extra library.  
It is already considered for next core releases. The mklittlefs tool is provided from there.
- For reference see [LITTLEFS esp32 library](https://github.com/lorol/LITTLEFS) for more details
- If you need the [mklittlefs tool](https://github.com/earlephilhower/mklittlefs) download the [release](https://github.com/earlephilhower/mklittlefs/releases) or find it [archived at previous releases here](https://github.com/lorol/arduino-esp32fs-plugin/releases )
- Copy **mklittlefs[.exe]** to **/tools** folder of esp32 platform where **espota** and **esptool** (.py or.exe) tools are located

## Notes for FatFS

- Go to Arduino IDE menu: ***Tools > Partition Scheme*** and select an entry with FAT partition
- If not provided by the core, you may need additional binary files for Windows or Linux, thanks [@lbernstone](https://github.com/lbernstone) for compiling - or take them from the author [here - mkfatfs tool](https://github.com/labplus-cn/mkfatfs/releases/tag/v1.0) , thanks to [labplus-cn](https://github.com/labplus-cn/mkfatfs) or take from [archived previous release here](https://github.com/lorol/arduino-esp32fs-plugin/releases )
- If missing, you need to copy **mkfatfs[.exe]** to **/tools** folder of esp32 platform where **espota** and **esptool** (.py or.exe) tools are located
- The usable size of FAT partition is reduced with 1 sector of 4096 bytes (0x1000) to resolve wear leveling space requirement. The image file is flashed with +4096 bytes (0x1000) offset of partition address of csv table entry
- You may need to decrease **maxOpenFiles** at FFat.begin() of your sketch , [see this note](http://marc.merlins.org/perso/arduino/post_2019-03-30_Using-FatFS-FFat-on-ESP32-Flash-With-Arduino.html) 
>The FFAT module uses 8KB plus 4KB per concurrent file that can be opened. By default, it allows 10 files to be opened, which means it uses 48KB. IF you want to reduce its memory use, you can tell it to only support one file, and you will save 36KB, leaving you with only 12KB used.
```
if (!FFat.begin(0, "", 1)) die("Fat FS mount failed. Not enough RAM?");
```
- To flash the data folder as FAT partition by **network port (uses espota)**, replace your esp32-core Update library with the [modified files here](https://github.com/lorol/arduino-esp32fatfs-plugin/tree/master/extra/esp32-modified-Update-lib-ffat-espota.zip)

## Installation

- Make sure you use one of the supported versions of Arduino IDE and have ESP32 core installed.
- Download **esp32fs.zip** zipped tool from [latest release](https://github.com/lorol/arduino-esp32fs-plugin/releases)
- In your Arduino sketchbook directory, create tools directory if it doesn't exist yet.
- Unpack the tool into "Setup->sketchbook location" **/tools** directory. Example: ```<home_dir>/Arduino/tools/ESP32FS/tool/esp32fs.jar``` or on OSX ```/Applications/Arduino.app/Contents/Java/tools/ESP32FS``` .
- Make sure you have **mklittlefs[.exe]** and **mkfatfs[.exe]** available at esp32 core installation folder. Look inside of **\AppData\Local\Arduino15\...** or on zip IDE install, see "Setup->sketchbook location" **hardware\espressif\esp32\tools**
- For reference, see at [previous releases](https://github.com/lorol/arduino-esp32fs-plugin/releases) for copies of archived binaries in question. 
- You can also use provided **package_esp32_index.template.json** to run **get.py** with it and download the missing binary files
- Restart Arduino IDE. 

## Usage

- Open a sketch (or create a new one and save it).
- Go to sketch directory (choose Sketch > Show Sketch Folder).
- Create a directory named `data` and any files you want in the file system there.
- Make sure you have selected a board, port, partition scheme and closed Serial Monitor.
- Select ***Tools > ESP32 Sketch Data Upload*** menu item. 
- On drop-down list, select SPIFFS, LittleFS or FatFS you want to make from your /data folder.
- Clicking OK should start uploading the files into ESP32 flash file system.
- Last entry **!Erase Flash!** allows to clean the entire flash if necessary. 

  When done, IDE status bar will display the status of Image Uploaded message. Might take a few minutes for large file system sizes.

## Quick build on Win:

- Install Java JDK 
- Find the path of javac.exe and jar.exe
- Find where files **arduino-core.jar , commons-codec-1.7.jar , pde.jar**  of your Arduino IDE installation are located
- Edit **make_win.bat** to match "your" paths for **set PATH=your\java\bin;%PATH%** and **set ALP=your\arduino\lib** 
- Run **make_win.bat**
- Find the **jar** file in src/bin directory
